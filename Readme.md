### 1.2 Software for chip setup
The PSoC6 microcontroller on the OTX-18 can be freely configured with PSoC Creator
1. Download PSoC Creator [from here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17IZQReRqCk6mNGf5SMYcHy2We6gLfeac?usp=share_link)
1. Download PDL 3.1.7 [from the same location](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17IZQReRqCk6mNGf5SMYcHy2We6gLfeac?usp=share_link)
1. Install PSoC Creator (after installation, check the bottom checkbox to continue without registration information)
1. Install PDL 3.1.7
1. Run PSoC Creator and set the freshly installed PDL by `TOOLS` -> `OPTIONS` -> `PDL v3 (PSoC6 devices) location:` -> `C:\Program Files (x86)\Cypress\PDL\3.1.5`
1. Close PSoC Creator

### 1.3 OTX-Maestro
The OTX-18 can be programmed and debugged with OTX-Meaestro (Visual Studio Code based Integrated Development Environment)
1. Install OTX-Meaestro according [the instructions from here](https://github.com/onethinx/OTX-Maestro-Windows)

### 1.4 FarmBug and programming hardware
1. Make sure the programmer, adapter PCB and cable are connected to the FarmBug as shown:<br>

1. Do not install the battery when using the debugger.

## 2 FarmBug Project: Chip Configuration, Firmware Coding and Debugging

### 2.1 FarmBug Chip Setup / Configuration Project (uses PSoC Creator)

1. Download the FarmBug Project [from here](https://github.com/onethinx/Workshop_29May2023/raw/main/Assets/OTX-FarmBug.zip)
1. After downloading, right click the .zip file and select 'Extract All'. Choose a short folder path and make sure the folder ends with `\OTX-FarmBug` (e.g. `C:\OTX-FarmBug`)
1. Open (double click) `Onethinx_Creator.cyprj` inside the project folder `..\OTX-FarmBug\Onethinx_Creator.cydsn`. PSoC Creator will open<br>
![PSoCCreator_WorkspaceExplorer](https://github.com/onethinx/Workshop_29May2023/blob/main/Assets/PSoCCreator_WorkspaceExplorer.png?raw=true)<br>
1. Open (double click) `TopDesign.cysch` and view the internal wiring of the PSoC6, causing the LED to flash
1. Open `Pins` from the Design Wide Resources to configure the LED IO pin
1. Watch the schematic and find out the right IO pin the LED is connected with<br>
![LED pin](https://github.com/onethinx/Workshop_29May2023/blob/main/Assets/LEDpin.png?raw=true)<br>
1. Click the dropdown arrow and select the IO pin we just found for the LED<br>
![PinConfig](https://github.com/onethinx/Workshop_29May2023/blob/main/Assets/PinConfig.png?raw=true)<br>
1. Now the LED is configured for the right IO, the OTX / PSoC6 configuration project is ready to be built
1. Hit the Build Icon in the toolbar or select `Build >> Build Onethinx_Creator (Shift + F6)`<br>
![Build](https://github.com/onethinx/Workshop_29May2023/blob/main/Assets/Build.png?raw=true)<br>
1. Wait for PSoC Creator to build the configuration project<br>
![Output](https://github.com/onethinx/Workshop_29May2023/blob/main/Assets/Output.png?raw=true)<br>
1. The message `Build Succeeded` will appear when building is ready without issues
1. Chip configuration is done, PSoC Creator may now be closed.

### 2.2 Firmware Coding and Debugging (uses Visual Studio Code)

1. Start Visual Studio Code
1. Open the OTX-FarmBug folder (not the .zip file)<br>
![VScode Open](https://github.com/onethinx/Workshop_29May2023/blob/main/Assets/VS_Code_Open.png?raw=true)<br>
1. As the project has not run on the PC before, it needs to be Clean-Reconfigured before it can be built. Hit the `Clean-Reconfigure` button from the status bar at the bottom of VS Code<br>
![Clean Build Launch](https://github.com/onethinx/Workshop_29May2023/blob/main/Assets/Clean_Build_Launch.png?raw=true)<br>
1. After successfull configuration (the terminal window will show: "Terminal will be reused by tasks, press..." when ready), the project can be Built and Launched from the debugger. 
  Make sure the FarmBug is connected to the debugger and PC before launching the debug session
  Hit the `Build-And-Launch` button from the status bar at the bottom of VS Code
1. Cross fingers and hopefully the firmware will be programmed, the project will enter debug mode (yellow bar) and the blue LED will be flashingðŸŽ‰<br>

1. Congratulations, you're now qualified Onethinx Rookie<br>ðŸ¤“
